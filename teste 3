31.9: For this especific purpose I would choose an agile development team. A agile development team is as small but motivated team, 
their main characteristics are informal methods, minimal software engineering work products, and overall development simplicity. A Agile
development team makes uses of tools and process like SCRUM, that prioritize speed and simplicity over slow process and documentation.

32.6: Size is not quality, doesn't matter how many lines of code do you made, if there's no organization and pattern in them, it will be 
troublesome to repair or to make other people besides you understand it, beyond that, a good code is also self-contained, and as simple
as it can be.

33.2: Creation of custom AI
      Create BOT
      Graphical Interface
      Complex Algorithms
      Mobile Interface
      User Friendly Interface
      

34.5: Small projects with small teams can be benefited of having more people working on the project. Although time can be wasted on
teaching how the system works and the complexity of communication grows, if the work of the hired people are highly compartmentalized,
it can benefit the project schedule.
