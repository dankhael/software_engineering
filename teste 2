It's possible to combine two process models.For example, if you have to build a system/project that requirements have to be stable and well
defined, but you have to be the fastest as possible, maybe it's a good idea to combine the sequential process model, like waterfall, with
the incremental process model.

Depending on the complexity of the project, the development of it may last for years, and after some time, the demands  and necessities of 
the market or the client probably have changed. That's why the dev team must be prepared for changes and adaptions in the requirement.

6.7:
Communication of the whole team. in conventional teams, the structure is hierarchical and each one do your part of the project. In agile
develepment teams, everyone must know everything about the project,even if it's not your area or expertise, that help the team to have a
notion of how the project is going on and how close they are to their common goal.

Models are important because can help and guide those who will implement the application. In a simplified project, models may not be that
important, because it would be easier to implement.
